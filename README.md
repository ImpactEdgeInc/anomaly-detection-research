This repository will show the results of various methods to predict sustainability data and track anomalies present in the data.

 - **`lstm_testing`** shows the results of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict stationary combustion (Scope 1) data.
 - **`isolation-forest-detection`** detects anomalies in stationary combustion (Scope 1) data using an Isolated Forest model and assigns them "anomaly scores" depending on how likely they are to actually be anomalies.


Please refer to the individual `README.md` files in each folder if there are any issues with running the files inside.
